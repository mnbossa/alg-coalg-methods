# Algebraic and Coalgebraic Methods in the Mathematics of Program Construction
## Definitions and main results


This is an overview I'm writing as I read the book
[Algebraic and Coalgebraic Methods in the Mathematics of Program Construction](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540436133).
The information included is what I consider important.

A PDF can be generated using [org-mode export](http://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html) or one reasonably
updated should be available in the [pdf branch](https://github.com/paraseba/alg-coalg-methods/blob/pdf/main-results.pdf)
